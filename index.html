      <p>
        All that is gold does not glitter, <br>
        Not all those who wander are lost; <br>
        The old that is strong does not wither, <br>
        Deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br><br>
        From the ashes, a fire shall be woken, <br>
        A light from the shadows shall spring; <br>
        Renewed shall be blade that was broken, <br>
        The crownless again shall be king. <br><br>
        - J.R.R Tolkein
